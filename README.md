## What is TORIIS.earth?
[TORIIS.earth](https://www.toriis.earth/) (Transparent and Open Resource for Institutional Investments) is an interactive and dynamic web interface to visualize the University of Illinois Systems’ investment portfolio, focusing on assets invested in corporations that profit from the extraction, transportation, or combustion of coal, petroleum, or natural gas.

It allows users to search, sort, visualize, and analyze the University of Illinois System’s investments. It enables administrators to update databases, manage administrative access, and systematically maintain the website.
